<h2>Hi, I'm Adedayo 👋</h2>

<p><strong>AWS Cloud Architect | Cloud Security Specialist | DevSecOps Engineer</strong></p>

<p>
I design, deploy, and secure scalable AWS environments aligned with business,
compliance, and operational requirements.
</p>

<p>
My expertise includes cloud security architecture, identity and access management (IAM),
network segmentation, encryption strategy, multi-account governance, and DevSecOps integration.
</p>

<p>
I work closely with engineering and security teams to implement secure-by-design architectures
that reduce operational risk, strengthen system resilience, and support long-term scalability.
</p>

<p>
My focus is on delivering secure, reliable, and cost-efficient cloud solutions while contributing
to strategic cloud transformation initiatives.
</p>

<h2>📊 Impact Highlights</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Strengthened governance</strong> through multi-account Service Control Policy (SCP) enforcement.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduced configuration drift</strong> through automated compliance monitoring and remediation workflows.</li>
  <li><strong>Improved incident response readiness</strong> through centralized logging, monitoring, and threat detection architecture.</li>
</ul>
