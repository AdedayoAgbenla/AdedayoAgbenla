<br/>

<p>
I am an AWS Cloud Architect with hands-on experience in designing, deploying, and securing scalable cloud environments.  
I specialize in building reliable, cost-efficient, and highly available systems that meet business and compliance requirements.

I have strong experience in cloud security architecture, identity and access management (IAM), network security, and data protection.  
I work closely with development, operations, and security teams to integrate security best practices into daily workflows.

My objective is to continuously develop my technical and leadership skills while delivering secure, scalable, and high-performing cloud solutions.  
I aim to help organizations reduce operational risks, improve system reliability, optimize cloud costs, and adopt modern cloud technologies.  
In the long term, I seek to contribute to strategic cloud initiatives, mentor junior engineers, and support digital transformation through secure and innovative cloud architectures.
